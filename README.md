# Laptop-Price-Prediction
### Developed an end-to-end system which predicts the price of laptop on the basis of specification.

###### The project is based on developing regression model to predict the price of laptop.
###### The dataset which is used in this project is custom dataset which I found online.
###### Initially this dataset had thirteen columns like: company, RAM, screen-resolution, weight, etc. So I have done some feature engineering which helped to make model more accurate.

###### I have applied algorithms like Linear-Regression, Random-Forest Regressor, SVM Regressor, Decision-Tree Regressor, Ada-Boost Regressor etc.

###### For developing front-end I have used streamlit library which is used to create application easily.

### Images below are explaining how good the model is working.
